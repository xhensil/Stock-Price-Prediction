# Stock-Price-Prediction
A stock price prediction machine learning project involves using historical data to predict the future price of a stock. The goal of this project is to develop a model that accurately predicts the price of a given stock over a certain period of time.


Stock price prediction using machine learning in Python can be done using a variety of techniques, such as regression, time-series forecasting, and deep learning. Here are some steps to get started:

1. Collect and preprocess the data: You can obtain stock price data from various sources, such as Yahoo Finance or Google Finance. Once you have the data, you may need to clean and preprocess it to remove missing values, outliers, and other errors.

2. Choose a machine learning model: You can use regression models, such as linear regression or polynomial regression, to predict stock prices based on historical data. Alternatively, you can use time-series forecasting models, such as ARIMA or Prophet, to predict future stock prices based on patterns in the historical data. Deep learning models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, can also be used to predict stock prices.

3. Train the model: Split the data into training and testing sets, and use the training set to train the machine learning model. You may need to experiment with different parameters and hyperparameters to find the best model for your data.
